CS143 Team Project
3. (Based on Gaddis programming challenges 7.1) Rainfall Class
Create a text file that has 18 doubles with the average monthly rainfall for Olympia in the last year.
Write a RainFall class that stores the total rainfall for each of 18 months into an array of doubles. The program must accept the input out of chronological order and store it in sorted order.
Input dates as an integer, stored in the file as YYYYMM. 
Sample input file:
201802  1.3
201701  2.5     
201803  4.0
201711  3.5
201802  1.2
 . . . etc.
The program should have methods that return the following:
• Output the rainfall and date (YYYYMM) in order sorted by date
• The total rainfall on record
• The average monthly rainfall
• The month with the most rain
• The month with the least rain
Demonstrate the class in a complete program. Do not perform input validation.
